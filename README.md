positive classes and remaining values false positive classes. Problem statement – The weather dataset has information about date, precipitation, temperature max, temperature min, wind, weather. Identify dependent and independent variable write codes for logistic regression by taking training size is 70% and remaining data for testing and check the accuracy.



Tools used- pandas, sklearn, logistic regression, label encoder, matplotlib, seaborn.



Outcome – The logistic regression weather forecasting project accuracy is 68% predicted weather dependent variable. 161 and 140 are true.
